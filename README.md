# Worker Pod Autoscaler

[![GoDoc Widget]][GoDoc] [![CI Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/practo/k8s-worker-pod-autoscaler.svg?token=yTs54joHywqVVdshXhPm&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/practo/k8s-worker-pod-autoscaler)

----

Scale kubernetes pods based on the Queue length of a queue in a Message Queueing Service. Worker Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment based on observed queue length.

Currently the supported Message Queueing Services are:
- [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)
- [Beanstalkd](https://beanstalkd.github.io/)

There is a plan to integrate other commonly used message queing services.

----

# Install the WorkerPodAutoscaler

### Install
Running the below script will create the WPA [CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) and start the controller. The controller watches over all the specified queues in AWS SQS and scales the Kubernetes deployments based on the specification.

```bash
export AWS_REGIONS='ap-south-1,ap-southeast-1'
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='sample-aws-access-key-id'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='sample-aws-secret-acesss-key'
./hack/install.sh
```

Note: IAM policy required is [this](artifacts/iam-policy.json).

### Verify Installation
Check the wpa resource is accessible using kubectl

```bash
kubectl get wpa
```

# Example
Do install the controller before going with the example.

- Create Deployment that needs to scale based on queue length.
```bash
kubectl create -f artifacts/examples/example-deployment.yaml
```

- Create `WPA object (example-wpa)` that will start scaling the `example-deployment` based on SQS queue length.
```bash
kubectl create -f artifacts/examples/example-wpa.yaml
```

This will start scaling `example-deployment` based on SQS queue length.

## Configuration

## WPA Resource
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.practo.dev/v1alpha1
kind: WorkerPodAutoScaler
metadata:
  name: example-wpa
spec:
  minReplicas: 0
  maxReplicas: 10
  deploymentName: example-deployment
  queueURI: https://sqs.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/{{aws_account_id}}/{{queue_prefix-queue_name-queue_suffix}}
  targetMessagesPerWorker: 2
  secondsToProcessOneJob: 0.03
  maxDisruption: "100%"
```
Beanstalk's queueURI would be like: `beanstalk://beanstalkDNSName:11300/test-tube`

### WPA Spec documentation:
- **minReplicas**: minimum number of workers you want to run. (mandatory)
- **maxReplicas**: maximum number of workers you want to run. (mandatory)
- **deploymentName**: name of the kubernetes deployment in the same namespace as WPA object. (mandatory)
- **queueURI**: full URL of the queue. (mandatory)
- **targetMessagesPerWorker**: Number of jobs in the queue which have not been picked up by the workers. This also used to calculate the desired number of workers. (mandatory)
- **secondsToProcessOneJob:**: This metric is useful to calculate the desired number of workers more accurately. It is particularly very useful for workers which have `targetMessagesPerWorker` as always zero. `secondsToProcessOneJob` in the combination with `messagesSentPerMinute`(queue RPM) helps in calculating the minimum workers that is expected to be running to handle `messagesSentPerMinute`(RPM) with every job being processed in `secondsToProcessOneJob` seconds. (optional, highly recommended, default=0.0 i.e. disabled)
- **maxDisruption:** amount of disruption that can be tolerated in a single scale down activity. Number of pods or percentage of pods that can scale down in a single down scale down activity. Using this you can control how fast a scale down can happen. This can be expressed both as an absolute value and a percentage. Explained with the help of some examples: (optional, default is the WPA flag `wpa-default-max-disruption`)
```
min=2, max=1000, current=500, maxDisruption=50%: then the scale down cannot bring down more than 250 pods in a single scale down activity.
```
```
min=2, max=1000, current=500, maxDisruption=125: then the scale down cannot bring down more than 125 pods in a single scale down activity.
```

## WPA Controller

```
$ bin/darwin_amd64/workerpodautoscaler run --help
Run the workerpodautoscaler

Usage:
  workerpodautoscaler run [flags]

Examples:
  workerpodautoscaler run

Flags:
      --aws-regions string                  comma separated aws regions of SQS (default "ap-south-1,ap-southeast-1")
      --beanstalk-long-poll-interval int    the duration (in seconds) for which the beanstalk receive message call waits for a message to arrive (default 20)
      --beanstalk-short-poll-interval int   the duration (in seconds) after which the next beanstalk api call is made to fetch the queue length (default 20)
  -h, --help                                help for run
      --k8s-api-burst int                   maximum burst for throttle between requests from clients(wpa) to k8s api (default 10)
      --k8s-api-qps float                   qps indicates the maximum QPS to the k8s api from the clients(wpa). (default 5)
      --kube-config string                  path of the kube config file, if not specified in cluster config is used
      --metrics-port string                 specify where to serve the /metrics and /status endpoint. /metrics serve the prometheus metrics for WPA (default ":8787")
      --queue-services string               comma separated queue services, the WPA will start with (default "sqs,beanstalkd")
      --resync-period int                   sync period for the worker pod autoscaler (default 20)
      --sqs-long-poll-interval int          the duration (in seconds) for which the sqs receive message call waits for a message to arrive (default 20)
      --sqs-short-poll-interval int         the duration (in seconds) after which the next sqs api call is made to fetch the queue length (default 20)
      --wpa-default-max-disruption string   it is the default value for the maxDisruption in the WPA spec. This specifies how much percentage of pods can be disrupted in a single scale down acitivity. Can be expressed as integers or as a percentage. (default "100%")
      --wpa-threads int                     wpa threadiness, number of threads to process wpa resources (default 10)

Global Flags:
  -v, --v Level   number for the log level verbosity
```

If you need to enable multiple queue support, you can add queues comma separated in `--queue-services`. For example, if beanstalkd is started and there is no WPA beanstalk resource present, then nothing happens, until a beanstalk WPA resource is created. Queue poller service only operates on the filtered WPA objects.
```
--queue-services=sqs,beanstalkd
```

### Troubleshoot (running WPA at scale)

Running WPA at scale require changes in `--k8s-api-burst` and `--k8s-api-qps` flags.

WPA makes update to Kubernetes API to update the WPA status. WPA uses [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) as the kubernetes client to make Kubernetes API calls. This client allows 5QPS and 10Burst requests to Kubernetes API by default. The defaults can be changed by using `k8s-api-burst` and `k8s-api-qps` flags.

You may need to increase the `--k8s-api-qps` and `k8s-api-burst` if [wpa_controller_loop_duration_seconds](https://github.com/practo/k8s-worker-pod-autoscaler/tree/master#wpa-metrics) is greater than 200ms (wpa_controller_loop_duration_seconds>0.200)

For ~800 WPA resources, 100 QPS keeps the `wpa_controller_loop_duration_seconds<0.200`

## WPA Metrics

WPA emits the following prometheus metrics at `:8787/metrics`.
```
wpa_controller_loop_count_success{workerpodautoscaler="example-wpa", namespace="example-namespace"} 23140
wpa_controller_loop_duration_seconds{workerpodautoscaler="example-wpa", namespace="example-namespace"} 0.39

wpa_log_messages_total{severity="ERROR"} 0
wpa_log_messages_total{severity="WARNING"} 0
wpa_log_messages_total{severity="INFO"} 0

go_goroutines{endpoint="workerpodautoscaler-metrics"} 40
```

If you have [ServiceMonitor](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/getting-started.md) installed in your cluster. You can bring these metrics to Prometheus by running the following:
```
kubectl create -f artifacts/service.yaml
kubctl create -f artifacts/servicemonitor.yaml
```

# Why make a separate autoscaler CRD ?

Go through [this medium post](https://medium.com/practo-engineering/launching-worker-pod-autoscaler-3f6079728e8b) for details.

Kubernetes does support custom metric scaling using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. Before making this we were using HPA to scale our worker pods. Below are the reasons for moving away from HPA and making a custom resource:

**TLDR;** Don't want to write and maintain custom metric exporters? Use WPA to quickly start scaling your pods based on queue length with minimum effort (few kubectl commands and you are done !)

1. **No need to write and maintain custom metric exporters**: In case of HPA with custom metrics, the users need to write and maintain the custom metric exporters. This makes sense for HPA to support all kinds of use cases. WPA comes with queue metric exporters(pollers) integrated and the whole setup can start working with 2 kubectl commands.

2. **Different Metrics for Scaling Up and Down**: Scaling up and down metric can be different based on the use case. For example in our case we want to scale up based on SQS `ApproximateNumberOfMessages` length and scale down based on `NumberOfMessagesReceived`. This is because if the worker jobs watching the queue is consuming the queue very fast, `ApproximateNumberOfMessages` would always be zero and you don't want to scale down to 0 in such cases.

3. **Fast Scaling**: We wanted to achieve super fast near real time scaling. As soon as a job comes in queue the containers should scale if needed. The concurrency, speed and interval of sync have been made configurable to keep the API calls to minimum.

4. **On-demand Workers:** min=0 is supported. It's also supported in HPA.

## Contributing
It would be really helpful to add all the major message queuing service providers. This [interface](https://github.com/practo/k8s-worker-pod-autoscaler/blob/master/pkg/queue/queueing_service.go#L5-L14) implementation needs to be written down to make that possible.

- After making code changes, run the below commands to build and run locally.
```
$ make build
making bin/darwin_amd64/workerpodautoscaler

$ bin/darwin_amd64/workerpodautoscaler run --kube-config /home/user/.kube/config
```
